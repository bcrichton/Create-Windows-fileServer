# DNS Enhancements & Creating Windows File Server
This project was completed during my undergraduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.
The purpose of this project was to learn the following:
* Creating a DNS suffix search list for a server not joined to the domain
* Adding a Reverse Lookup Zone to a DNS server, as well as creating PTR records
* Add a new virtual disk (VHD) to a VM
* Create a Windows network file shares on a Windows 2019 server
* Provision a Windows 10 workstation (VM)

Attached is the .PDF file of the entire project.
